            no one has seen robin lately, except when she surfaces for coffee. 
            <br>or chocolate. 
            <br>or both. 
            <br>or beer. 
            <br>sometimes all three. 
            <br>she is eye-ball-deep in learning the code. codecamp is 5.5 weeks in (but who's counting?) 
            <br>and she is confident she can hang in through at least week 6!
